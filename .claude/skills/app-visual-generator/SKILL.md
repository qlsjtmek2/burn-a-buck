## Task 1: Generate App Icon Prompts (512×512 px)

### Overview

App icons are the first touchpoint users have with your app. Users decide whether to tap or skip in **under 1 second**.

**Key Principles (Data-Driven):**

- **🚫 NO TEXT IN ICONS**: Text (한글/영문자) = 26% lower engagement

  - Text makes icons language-specific and less universal
- **High Contrast**: Bold outlines + clear colors = 28% better visibility

- **Cute/Playful Characters**: Emotional connection drives engagement
  - Korean cute style (LINE, Kakao) performs well in Asian markets
